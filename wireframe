1. Color Palette 🎨
Since it's a creative business, go for a bold yet professional color scheme:

Primary Color: A deep navy blue (#0A192F) or dark gray (#333333) for professionalism.
Secondary Accent: Bright orange (#FF6B35) or neon blue (#3A86FF) to add a creative pop.
Neutral Backgrounds: Light gray (#F8F8F8) or white for clean spaces.
Call-to-Action (CTA) Colors: A striking yellow (#FFC300) or vibrant green (#00C853) to grab attention.
2. Typography 📝
You need a mix of professional yet artistic fonts:

Headings: Use a bold, modern font like Montserrat or Poppins.
Body Text: A clean and readable sans-serif like Lato or Open Sans.
Logo/Branding Fonts: You can experiment with custom fonts like Playfair Display (for a touch of elegance).
3. Layout & Structure 📐
Your homepage should have a visual hierarchy that directs users to important sections smoothly.

📌 Hero Section (Above the Fold)
Full-screen background image or video showcasing your best designs, event setups, or branding work.
A short tagline like: "Design that Speaks. Events that Impress. Branding that Stands Out."
Call-to-Action (CTA) button: "See Our Work" or "Get a Free Quote"
📌 Services Section
Use three to four interactive cards to showcase:
🎨 Design Work (Graphic design, web design, UX/UI)
🎭 Events (Corporate events, weddings, product launches)
🏷️ Branding (Logo design, social media branding, merchandise)
Each card should have an icon, a short description, and a “Learn More” button.
📌 Portfolio Section
Use a masonry grid layout to display your past work (like Pinterest).
Allow hover effects that show project details.
Add a carousel slider for featured projects.
📌 Testimonials Section
Use a carousel slider or grid layout for client reviews.
Show logos of brands you've worked with.
📌 Contact Section
Include a form with Name, Email, Message, and a dropdown for service selection.
Show your social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn).
If you have a physical office, add an embedded Google Map.
4. Animations & Effects ✨
Smooth scroll animations for sections appearing as you scroll.
Hover effects on buttons and images.
Micro-interactions (e.g., buttons changing color on hover, subtle loading animations).
Dark mode toggle for a modern touch.
